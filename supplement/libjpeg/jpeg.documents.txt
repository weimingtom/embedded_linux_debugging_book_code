JPEG file format documents
--------------------------

The official standard for JPEG image compression is not available on-line.
To get it, you have to order a paper copy from ANSI; it's not cheap.
Ordering information is attached below.  If you are not in the USA, you
should try your national ISO member organization first.

A better source of information is the textbook "JPEG Still Image Data
Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell,
published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  638 pages,
price US$59.95.  This book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).  Unless you really need a
certified official copy of the standard, the textbook is a much better deal
than purchasing the standard directly: it's cheaper and includes a lot of
useful explanatory material.

The JPEG standard does NOT define a concrete image file format, only a
family of compression algorithms.  The Independent JPEG Group recommends
that one of these two file formats be used for JPEG-compressed images:
    JFIF:	for simple applications that just need the image data;
    TIFF:	for more complex applications that need to store extra
		data about an image, such as color correction curves.
JFIF is a simple, restrictive, but easily processed format.  TIFF is a
complex format that will let you represent almost anything you could want,
but it is less portable than JFIF since different applications tend to
implement different subsets of TIFF.

These formats are defined by the following documents:

jfif.ps.gz		JFIF 1.02 specification (in PostScript format)
TIFF6.ps.Z		TIFF 6.0 specification (in PostScript format)
TIFFTechNote2.txt.gz	TIFF Technical Note #2 (draft, text format)

The JPEG incorporation scheme found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a
number of serious problems.  IJG does not recommend the use of the TIFF 6.0
design (TIFF Compression tag 6).  Instead, we recommend the use of the JPEG
design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2 (Compression tag 7).

jfif.ps.gz is available in this archive (ftp.uu.net: graphics/jpeg),
as is TIFFTechNote2.txt.gz.  TIFF6.ps.Z is available by anonymous FTP
from sgi.com (192.48.153.1), file graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.Z.

Each of these documents assumes you have the JPEG standard, but is otherwise
self-contained.

In the USA, copies of the ISO JPEG standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales
at (212) 642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.
(Global will take credit card orders, ANSI won't.)  It's not cheap: as of
1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%
shipping/handling.  ITU is an alternative source for official copies of
the JPEG standard.

The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual specification,
while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is titled "Digital
Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 1: Requirements
and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-1, ITU-T T.81.
Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still
Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-2, ITU-T T.83.

Extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3, a new
ISO document.  Part 3 is undergoing ISO balloting and is expected to be
approved by the end of 1995; it will have document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-3, ITU-T T.84.

Part 3 defines a concrete file format called SPIFF, which is likely to
gradually replace JFIF; SPIFF/JPEG files should be readable by most existing
JFIF decoders, so the transition should be transparent to most users.  As of
late 1995, there are no implementations of SPIFF, but IJG intends to support
it in our next major release.
