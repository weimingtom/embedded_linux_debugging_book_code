GpsEmu.rar is a package, which contains source code file and some headers. I write these code under Microsoft Visual Studio 2005. It function as an GPS emulator. the emulating GPS data are chengdu city. I write it so that you do not have to own a real GPS device to run the application in this chapter. there are just limited button on the GpsEmu's main window, so, it's easy and simple. I'm happy to answer any questiong about GpsEmu. If you have some better idea, please let me know, anyway. Thank you!
